# DrMutoToolset

## Introduction

**DrMutoToolset** is a set of programs (henceforth referred to as a "toolset") meant for dealing with asset files present in the multi-platform (for 2002) console game **Dr. Muto**.

As the whole repository in which this toolset is based on is WIP and I'm just barely started with C++ as a programming language, the whole thing will look barebones to you. No license, no "building" section, nothing.

I cannot give any building instructions at this time, but what you do need to know for now is that this was programmed in **Visual Studio 2022 Version 17.6.3**, with the **C++ desktop extension** installed to make this a reality.

The entire toolset was tested with **Windows 10 Pro 22H2** as its operating system, with **64-bit support** based on the **x86-64 instruction set**.

## The Titular Toolset

As of this writing, the toolset consists of the following programs:

- [**DrMutoPackTool**](DrMutoPackTool/README.md) - A tool for unpacking all files from bigfiles based on an input name. Given that the **PlayStation2** and **Xbox** versions of the game contain packed bigfiles ranging in size from 150MB to under 2GB, you may be on the lookout for this one.

They are all meant to be run on the command-line terminal.

## Lasting Words

Happy tinkering!
